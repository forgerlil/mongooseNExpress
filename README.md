Changes:

- Now that our setup is in place, we can go to our Author controller functions and start querying our database with the Mongoose methods.
- We will build a simple GET request to retrieve all the authors from the database.
- For that, you need to add one or two authors to the database manually, otherwise proceed to step 5 where we build a POST request to add authors to the database.
