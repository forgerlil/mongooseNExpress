Changes:

- We now have a POST request where a new author can be added to the database.
- When sending your POST request via Postman/Insomnia, remember to add a body to your request, and make sure to select the option "raw" and "JSON" in the dropdown menu.
- Check index.js to see how to handle our apps incoming data.
