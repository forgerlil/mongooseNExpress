This repo starts at the final point of this repo: https://github.com/forgerlil/node-crash-course

Through the Mongoose library facilitator, we will build a connection to our database, create a model and create, get and update data through it!

If you are familiar with the repo linked above, this repo also follows the same steps:
  - Make sure to start on the main branch, and check out the other branches to see the changes made to the code, step by step.
  - The command is simply "git checkout step-x" where x is the number of the step you want to see.
  - For every commit, the README file will be updated as well, make sure to check it out too!
