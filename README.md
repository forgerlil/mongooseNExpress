Changes:

- We now have a PUT and DELETE requests for our authors.
- It can grow a lot more from just these requests, naturally. You don't necessarily need to
  use the same structure as I did, but it's a good guideline. Always consider what are your
  project's needs and how you can best structure your API to meet them!

  The End :)
